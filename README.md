# dotfiles
These are my personal dotfiles which have traversed several linux distributions (Arch, Fedora, Gentoo, Debian). They are a constant work-in-progress and quite possibly the ugliest things you'll ever read but they work and are up-to-date as I use my system daily.


Use *df_install.sh* to automate symlink creation after pulling down dotfile.
